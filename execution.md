## JavaScript Execution Contexts

An execution context is an abstract concept that defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It consists of three components:

1. **Variable Environment**: This is where the variables declared within a function are stored. It also contains any function declarations within the current scope.

2. **Lexical Environment**: Here, you'll find the variables declared outside of a function, and it also contains any variables declared within the current scope.

3. **This Binding**: The "this" binding refers to the value of the "this" keyword within the current scope.

When a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the order in which functions are called. The function at the top of the call stack is the one currently being executed.

Once a function finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the call stack, and control is returned to the function that called it.

Understanding how execution contexts and the call stack work in JavaScript is crucial for debugging your code and avoiding errors. For instance, if you have a function that calls itself recursively, you can quickly run into a "stack overflow" error if you're not careful.
