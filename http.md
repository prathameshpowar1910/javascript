## ***What are HTTP headers?***

- HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.

- Metadata is sent in the form of header which is used to pass additional information about the request or response. 

- ***Metadata*** is nothing but the additional information about the data that is sent in the form of key-value pairs along with the request or response.
